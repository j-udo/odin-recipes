    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Nigerian beans and plantain bowl is a hearty, comforting dish that
      combines soft-cooked stewed beans with sweet, caramelized fried plantains.
      Often made with black-eyed peas or honey beans (ewa oloyin), the beans are
      simmered in a rich tomato-onion sauce seasoned with traditional spices.
      The result is a creamy, savory base that pairs perfectly with golden,
      crispy slices of ripe plantain.
