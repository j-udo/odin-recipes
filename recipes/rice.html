    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Jollof rice is a vibrant and flavorful West African dish made primarily
      from long-grain parboiled rice, tomatoes, onions, and a blend of spices.
      It is often cooked in a single pot, allowing the ingredients to meld
      together, creating a rich and deeply spiced base that infuses the rice
      with a reddish-orange hue. Typically, ingredients like bell peppers,
      garlic, ginger, and chili peppers are blended into the tomato sauce,
      giving the dish its signature tasteâ€”savory, slightly sweet, and a touch
      smoky when cooked properly. Depending on the region or family tradition,
      it may be prepared with vegetables, fried plantains, or proteins like
      chicken, beef, or fish.
