    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Jollof rice is a vibrant and flavorful West African dish made primarily
      from long-grain parboiled rice, tomatoes, onions, and a blend of spices.
      It is often cooked in a single pot, allowing the ingredients to meld
      together, creating a rich and deeply spiced base that infuses the rice
      with a reddish-orange hue. Typically, ingredients like bell peppers,
      garlic, ginger, and chili peppers are blended into the tomato sauce,
      giving the dish its signature taste—savory, slightly sweet, and a touch
      smoky when cooked properly. Depending on the region or family tradition,
      it may be prepared with vegetables, fried plantains, or proteins like
      chicken, beef, or fish.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Long-grain parboiled rice – 2 cups</li>
      <li>Tomatoes (fresh or canned) – 4 medium or 1 cup canned</li>
      <li>Red bell peppers – 2 large</li>
      <li>Onions – 2 medium (1 for the sauce, 1 sliced for cooking)</li>
      <li>Garlic cloves – 2–3</li>
      <li>Fresh ginger – 1 tablespoon, grated</li>
      <li>Tomato paste – 2 tablespoons</li>
      <li>Vegetable or chicken stock – 2–3 cups</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil – 1/4 cup</li>
      <li>Bay leaves – 1–2</li>
      <li>Salt – to taste</li>
      <li>Black pepper – to taste</li>
      <li>Thyme – 1 teaspoon</li>
      <li>Curry powder – 1 teaspoon</li>
      <li>Paprika or chili powder (optional, for heat) – to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Blend tomatoes, red bell peppers, 1 onion, garlic, and ginger into a
        smooth mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rinse the rice thoroughly. You can parboil it briefly to reduce starch,
        then drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large pot. Sauté sliced onions, then add tomato paste and
        fry for a few minutes. Add the blended mixture and cook until the sauce
        thickens and the oil begins to separate (about 15–20 minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add thyme, curry powder, bay leaves, salt, black pepper, and
        paprika/chili (if using). Pour in the stock and bring to a simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the rice, making sure it’s evenly coated. Cover the pot with
        foil or parchment paper under the lid to trap steam.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let it cook on low heat for 25–35 minutes, stirring occasionally and
        adding small amounts of water or stock if needed to prevent burning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed, fluff with a fork.
        Optionally, stir in cooked meat or vegetables. Serve hot.
      </li>
